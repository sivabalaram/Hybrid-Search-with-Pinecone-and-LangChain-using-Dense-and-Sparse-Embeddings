Yeah, so, miss, actually, we are from Bonito Designs, Which is an leading international interior designing firm, and we are just getting up for a mega launch in the coming month of February in Mumbai itself. So my question to you is: are you looking out for any interior designing services for your home. any kind of renovation project? Any small work, any small changes you have to meet? How did you get my number? host of all? I'm curious to ask this. Yes, absolutely actually, miss, We are just calling out for our interested customer. whoever searched on social media Interior designing in, not you might be your own person. Yeah, no. Yeah, so I know. I I thought, as if you know, because I just taken my position, I have and I'm definitely looking out for an interior designer. So I thought you have Contacted to my builder or someone from there. I already take some work for someone else and then you have contacted, Anyway, so mine is a 2BHK plant and I'm looking out for an interior which would not include the civil work But, yes. would include all painting with the furniture And you know everything else apart from that, I guess there would be no tiling, winding work included in it. But apart from tiling and apart from the civil work, there would be rest. everything that is included. Okay, and is there any specific kind of budget which you have set up on your mind? I am actually looking out for not more than 12 to 13 lakhs. Uh-huh, So that is what my budget is, but would not be looking out for so soon. I would, I think of starting with the interior in, say, around March or April. March or April. okay, that that would be great, because we are just Coming up with a mega launch in the coming month of February and we are a Bangalore based company. We are, we have Give a got a many international awards. You can check on YouTube as well. We are the most subscribed Channel over you. but then you have idea of Mumbai residences and all, like you know, mobile residences are very, very small As compared to Bangalore and we would want to prefer- and again, Mumbai residences and Projects are something- because no storage with the small occupancy, with no balcony. Yes, we would be. specifically, if you are asking me. I would look out for an interior designer who's going to give me an apt interior for you know Thing for me. which includes the storage with a very smart form, so that my area, my room itself, Is the you know, spacious enough for me. Absolutely. So it's not congested at all. Yes. So, absolutely. So the thing is miss our interior designer expert, whose name is a Gabrielle. he has about it with many international awards And the best part, and the best part, we have to be honest- We have built more than 2500 plus designs in Bangalore itself and Now we are heading towards Mumbai. So, yeah, we, the Gabrielle Hill, has more experience, how to you know How to utilize the spaces, and even I decide in Mumbai itself. So I know, in Mumbai, the we have very congested area. We don't have to be In, so it has to be used very smartly. So, yeah, absolutely, I'm really agree to it. So what I'll do is I'll give you a follow-up. like, we have an experience center. See, we, as an Indian, unless we feel and touch the material which are going to use at our home. We won't be convenient or we won't be Sure enough that we are going to buy it or not, right? Yeah, so that's the reason we have a experience center, like what kind of material we are going to use and What kind of team we have. we don't have any kind of catalog system. We do not follow any catalog system. So you have any exhibition you seeing next month or you know, next you you going to. you are you inviting for your product? No, actually it has already been launched. We are just, we are just pushing up more, more and more customer to get known about bonito. So now the experience center is already built up.
